WinRAR - What's new in the latest version
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Version 5.80 beta 2
   
   1. Changes to the "Find file" operation and to the "i" command in mode
      character:

      a) The "Use all character tables" option, or the "t" option
         for the "i" command, as well as using character encodings
         ANSI, OEM and UTF-16 now also use UTF-8 encoding.
      
      b) Improved support for Unicode texts.

      c) Improve search performance, especially non-search
         case-sensitive.

      d) The result of a hexadecimal search includes both the text in
         clear that in hexadecimal for the found objects.

   2. Progress progress bar for files and totals now comes
      also displayed when you unpack from format archives
      tar.bz2, tar.gz, tar.lz, tar.xz and tar.z.

      Previous versions only displayed these bars for archives
      in tar.bz2, tar.gz and tar.z. format No is displayed
      slash if you unpack archives in tar.lz and tar.xz format

   3. The "File List"> "File"> "Exact Size" option changes the
      how to display the file size also for the
      WinRAR status bar.
   
   4. Added support for another variant of the archive format
      TAR.

   5. Problems solved:

      a) The WinRAR extraction command present in the contextual menu
         Windows "Explorer" failed if it was in the RAR.INI file
         defined the "-ag" option.
   
   
   Version 5.80 beta 1
   
   1. The item "Keep the last access time of the source file"
      in the "Timetables" section of the Storage dialog
      allows you to keep the original Last Modified time.

   2. The command line option -tsp can be used for
      preserve the time of last access of an archived file. can he
      be combined with other -ts options, such as:
      "rar a -tsc -tsp file archive_name".

   3. You can now combine multiple modifiers of the -ts option.
      For example, you can enter -tscap instead of -tsc -tsa -tsp.

   4. WinRAR can read the default options from the RAR.INI text file
      which must be placed either in the same folder as WinRAR.exe or
      in the% APPDATA% \ WinRAR folder.
      This file must contain one instruction per line in one of the two
      possible formats:

       switches = <any space-separated RAR option>
       switches_ <command> = <any space-separated RAR option>

      The first sets the options for all commands, the second for a
      specific command.

      Some examples:
       switches = -m5 -s
       switches_x = -o +

      Most of the options defined in the RAR.INI file come
      used in command line mode. Other options instead
      they are applied both in command line and in that
      graphics.

   5. The command-line option -agf <default_format> specifies the
      default format for the -ag option. It has value only if inserted
      in the RAR.INI configuration file or in the RAR environment variable.
      For example, if you insert the RAR in the environment variable
      definition "-agfYYYY-MMM-DD", in the command line we can
      simply enter -ag to use the definition
      of the format "YYYY-MMM-DD".

  Bug fixes and new features in GrabIt 1.2.1 beta (January 2001)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed the ads! For now I replaced it with a static image until I find another purpose for this window space;
- Multiple server support! Probably the most requested feature has been implemented. No fancy stuff yet, just the possibility to work with an unlimited amount of servers;
- Minimize to tray feature;
- Changed the width of the buttons so all buttons are always visible;
- Replaced the 'Grab first' button with a 'Move up' and a 'Move down' button to change an items position in the batch. 'Grab first' is still available by right-clicking on an item;
- 'Grab first' option in the pop-up menu of the first tab;
- Deleting items from the batch is much faster;
- Updating the article view with a large batch is much faster;
- Find will now hide the items that do not match the search key;

- Application won't freeze anymore when headers are being analyzed during shutdown;
- Removed the window movement restrictions.

  Bug fixes and new features in GrabIt 1.1.3 beta (January 2001)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- GrabIt 1.1.2 introduced the 'empty list after group update' bug again. I now solved it for good. The problem is that some servers sometimes just stop responding. GrabIt detected this as an error and would shutdown the download routine without parsing the data. Now it will parse the headers that were already received. Incremental update can then get the rest of the headers;
- Fixed the freezing problem during shutdown;
- Fixed the corrupt binary problem that still occurred on some servers.

   6. The -ed and -e + d options can be used for managing
      an archive for any operating system. In versions
      previous RAR for Windows could not use it for RAR archives
      created under Unix and vice versa.

   7. Previously the "Check" command failed the integrity check
      for archives that stored alternative NTFS and data streams
      reported a message "Unknown data format
      header "if the size of this data exceeded 16MB.
      This limitation has been removed.
   
   8. Archiving speed for large streams has been improved
      alternative NTFS data with multi-processor CPU.
   
   9. "Find" command:

      a) when extracting encrypted files directly from the panel
         "Search result" was asked for the keyword for each
         files, even if they came from the same archive. Now the request
         it is done only once for all the files of a single
         archive.

      b) The keyboard shortcut Ctrl + A selects all the files in
        "Search result".

  10. Archive display panel:

      a) Previous versions did not allow you to close WinRAR a
         followed by typing Ctrl + W if it was open in
         view the comment of an archive
